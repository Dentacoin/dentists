                                        Three things to remember only:<br />
                                        1) When you create a wallet, your Dentacoin Wallet address will be automatically generated. This wallet address is comparable to your traditional IBAN. If patients or anyone else want to send you Dentacoin (DCN), they will need this address.<br />
                                        2) Your password and the Secret Key File generated upon creating your wallet are the most important access details. Comparable to the PIN of your credit/debit card, you cannot access your wallet if you don&#39;t have the password and the Secret Key File.<br />
                                        3) Only you are responsible for your wallet and the funds in it. Nobody else has access to it. Dentacoin B.V. do not store any access details of yours.</div>

To create a wallet type in your desired password in the Create section, then click the &ldquo;Create&rdquo; button. You will be prompted to download a Keystore/Secret Key File. A Secret Key File contains all your login information, but its contents are encrypted with your password. Without either one you will not be able to access your wallet. Make sure you store the file in a safe and secure place - that&rsquo;s the only way to access your wallet and only you are responsible for it. We do not store any user access details.<br />
